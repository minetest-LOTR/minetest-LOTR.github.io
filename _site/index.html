  three rings for the elven kings under the sky<br />

  <h4>A shadow is creeping across the land, an unstoppable mist of evil. Sauron and his legions of orcs have returned, striving to cleanse Middle-Earth of Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, and Men. Everything has failed. Middle-Earth needs a leader, a new hope to pierce the fog of evil that is descending on all. Only the truly brave, fearless, and noble can help. Will you dare to save the world from the forces of destruction? Or will you lead the fierce orcs in their conquest of the world? The choice is open to all brave enough to enter this epic new adventure.</h4>
