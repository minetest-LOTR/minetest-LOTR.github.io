  three rings for the elven kings under the sky<br />
  
  seven for the dwarf-lords in their halls of stone<br />
  
  nine for the mortal men doomed to die<br />
  
  one for the dark lord on his dark throne<br />
  
  In the land of mordor where the shadows lie<br /> 
  
  one ring to rule them all one ring to find them<br /> 
  
  one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them<br />
  
  In the land of mordor where the shadows lie<br />
